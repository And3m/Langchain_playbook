## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from code_assistant import CodeAssistant

# Initialize the assistant
assistant = CodeAssistant(api_key="your_openai_key")

# Generate code
result = assistant.generate_code(
    task="Create a function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key",
    language="python",
    requirements="Include error handling and docstring"
)

# Explain code
explanation = assistant.explain_code(
    code="def fibonacci(n): return n if n <= 1 else fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)",
    language="python"
)

# Review code
review = assistant.review_code(
    code="your_code_here",
    language="python"
)

# Debug code
debug_result = assistant.debug_code(
    code="buggy_code_here",
    error_message="TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)",
    language="python"
)
```

### Code Generation Example

```python
# Generate a sorting algorithm
result = assistant.generate_code(
    task="Implement quicksort algorithm",
    language="python",
    requirements="Include comments and handle edge cases"
)

if result["status"] == "success":
    print(result["code"])
```

### Code Review Example

```python
# Review code for quality
code_to_review = """
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(items)):
        total = total + items[i]
    return total
"""

review = assistant.review_code(code_to_review, "python")
print(review["review"])
```

## Supported Languages

- **Primary**: Python (full feature support)
- **Secondary**: JavaScript, Java, C++, C# (code generation and explanation)
- **Others**: Most popular programming languages for basic tasks

## Key Components

### CodeAssistant Class
Main class that orchestrates all code-related tasks:
- `generate_code()` - Natural language to code conversion
- `explain_code()` - Code explanation and documentation
- `review_code()` - Quality assessment and suggestions
- `debug_code()` - Error analysis and fixing
- `analyze_complexity()` - Complexity metrics (Python only)
- `suggest_improvements()` - Optimization recommendations

### Specialized Chains
- **Code Generation Chain**: Converts requirements to code
- **Explanation Chain**: Analyzes and explains code functionality
- **Review Chain**: Assesses code quality and best practices
- **Debug Chain**: Identifies and fixes code issues

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Model Selection
```python
# Use different models for different needs
assistant = CodeAssistant(
    api_key="your_key",
    model="gpt-4"  # For better code quality
)
```
