plan = assistant.create_research_plan(
    topic="Impact of Remote Work on Productivity",
    goal="Comprehensive analysis of trends and factors",
    resources="academic databases, industry reports"
)

# Add sources
source = assistant.add_source(
    title="Remote Work Study 2024",
    url="https://example.com/study",
    content="Study content here...",
    author="Dr. Smith",
    publication_date="2024-01-15",
    source_type="academic_journal"
)

# Synthesize information
synthesis = assistant.synthesize_information()

# Generate citations
citations = assistant.generate_citations("APA")

# Create research report
report = assistant.generate_report("executive_summary")
```

### Research Planning Example

```python
# Create comprehensive research plan
result = assistant.create_research_plan(
    topic="Artificial Intelligence in Education",
    goal="Evaluate current implementations and future potential",
    resources="academic papers, case studies, interviews"
)

if result["status"] == "success":
    print(result["research_plan"])
```

### Source Assessment Example

```python
# Add and assess source credibility
source = assistant.add_source(
    title="AI in Schools: A Comprehensive Study",
    url="https://education-journal.com/ai-study",
    content="This study examines the implementation of AI tools...",
    author="Dr. Education Expert",
    publication_date="2024-02-01",
    source_type="academic_journal"
)

print(f"Credibility Score: {source.credibility_score}/10")
```

### Information Synthesis Example

```python
# Collect multiple sources first, then synthesize
assistant.research_context["topic"] = "Climate Change Mitigation"

# Add multiple sources...
# Then synthesize
synthesis = assistant.synthesize_information()

if synthesis["status"] == "success":
    print(synthesis["synthesis"])
```
