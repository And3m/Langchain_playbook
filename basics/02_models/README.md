# Models - Understanding LangChain Language Models

This section covers the different types of language models available in LangChain and how to use them effectively.

## Files in this Section

### 1. `llm_comparison.py`
**Compare different LLM types and providers**

- Completion vs Chat models
- Temperature and creativity control
- Max tokens and response length
- Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Model parameter effects

**Run it:**
```bash
python llm_comparison.py
```

### 2. `embeddings_example.py` (Coming soon)
**Working with embeddings models**

- Text embeddings generation
- Similarity calculations
- Vector representations
- Use cases for embeddings

### 3. `model_callbacks.py` (Coming soon)
**Monitoring and debugging models**

- Token usage tracking
- Response time monitoring
- Cost estimation
- Debug information

## What You'll Learn

1. **Model Types**: Completion LLMs vs Chat models
2. **Parameters**: Temperature, max_tokens, and their effects
3. **Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models
4. **Selection**: Choosing the right model for your task
5. **Optimization**: Balancing cost, speed, and quality

## Key Concepts

### Temperature Control
- `0.0`: Deterministic, consistent responses
- `0.5`: Balanced creativity and consistency  
- `1.0`: Maximum creativity and randomness

### Model Selection Guidelines
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fast, cost-effective for most tasks
- **GPT-4**: Higher quality, better reasoning, more expensive
- **Claude**: Good for analysis and creative tasks
- **Local models**: Privacy, no API costs, lower performance

### Best Practices
- Start with lower-cost models for prototyping
- Use temperature based on task requirements
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Test different models for your specific use case
- Consider latency requirements

## Common Use Cases

| Model Type | Best For | Example Tasks |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Chat Models | Conversations | Customer service, tutoring |
| Completion Models | Text generation | Writing, code completion |
| Embeddings | Similarity | Search, recommendations, clustering |

## Prerequisites

- API keys for desired providers (see [API Keys Guide](../../docs/api-keys.md))
- Basic understanding of LLM concepts
- Completed getting started examples

## Next Steps

After mastering models:
1. Learn about prompts in `../03_prompts/`
2. Understand how to chain models in `../04_chains/`
3. Structure output with `../05_output_parsers/`
