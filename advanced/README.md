## 🏗️ Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Custom Tool Development
Build a custom tool for your specific domain:
```python
# Example: Financial data analysis tool
class FinancialAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    name = "financial_analyzer"
    description = "Analyze financial metrics and trends"
    
    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Your implementation here
        pass
```

### Exercise 2: Multi-Agent Coordination
Create a research team with specialized agents:
- Research agent: Gathers information
- Analysis agent: Processes and analyzes data
- Writer agent: Creates reports
- Coordinator agent: Manages the workflow

### Exercise 3: Evaluation Pipeline
Build an automated evaluation system for your application:
- Define metrics relevant to your use case
- Create test datasets
- Implement automated scoring
- Set up continuous evaluation

### Exercise 4: Production Deployment
Deploy your application with:
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and logging

### Exercise 5: Performance Optimization
Optimize your application for:
- Response time (target: <2 seconds)
- Cost efficiency (reduce by 30%)
- Throughput (handle 100+ requests/minute)
- Quality maintenance (>90% user satisfaction)

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

- ❌ Exposing API keys in logs or responses
- ❌ Not implementing rate limiting

### Performance
- ❌ No caching strategy
- ❌ Synchronous processing for independent tasks
- ❌ Not monitoring token usage

### Architecture
- ❌ Tight coupling between agents
- ❌ No error handling or fallback mechanisms
- ❌ Monolithic deployment without scaling
